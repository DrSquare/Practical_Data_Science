# Practical Data Science

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share insights, experiments, codes, and resources related to my Medium blog posts. For more in-depth articles, please visit my blog at [minha-hwang.medium.com.](https://medium.com/@minha-hwang)

## <ins>About the Blog</ins> <br>
On my Medium blog, I explore topics including:

1. Practical Data Science: Marketing Data Science Cases - From Problem Definition to ML Solution <br>
2. Structured Problem-Solving Apporach for Data Science: Problem-Solving Approach for Data Scientists <br>
3. Entrepreneurship and Startups: Noticeable Gen AI Startups, AI industry trends, strategies, and stories about building and scaling ventures.<br>
4. AI and Machine Learning: Projects, AI learning materials, AI paper reviews, research highlights, and practical use cases.<br>
5. Personal Growth and Reflections: Thoughts on productivity, creativity, and continuous learning.
Each post is designed to share knowledge, spark discussion, and inspire others to explore new ideas.<br>
